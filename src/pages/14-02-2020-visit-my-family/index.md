### A Snowfall

During Christmas holidays in 2019, I went to back to China to visit my family, my wife and my son.

It was really enjoyable time initially. There was a snow ranges almost north of China. We were on are way back from hometown to Beijing to chatch the filght back to NZ. It was 900 km. It usually takes 12 hours to drive. However after I drove 2 hours, there was a snowfall. The highway was been shutdown, we were asked to go off highway. We went to small country road. That was mountain aera. On the way, I saw lots of truckes parking side of roads because of how slippery of roads. They did not feel safe to drive.

### Car Accident

When I was carefully acrossing a mountain, a slope, I could not stop my car and slided into a back of a truck. The driver of the truck did not feel it. My car was looking so bad. Luckly, there was no mechanical problems. It was still drivable. After I informed the truck driver, he took a look of his truck and agreed to let us on our way.

My wife and my son were terrified. My wife was so intense. She griped strongly her fists all the way and her fists were cold. I was so faithful and believed we will be fine. I tried to tell her a jok for relaxing. That was not help too much. We were in a middle of nowhere in a mountain. We had to carry on.

### A Small Town 

Then I saw a ute with a sign for saling snow chains. I brought a pair of the chains and put it on my car. I felt it improved a lot when I was putting my foot on break. In the evening, we reached a small town, ChangZi. 

It was getting dark. We decided to stay a hotel and tried to figure out next steps. The weather forecast showed that it was a national range of snow and it could coutinue for a week. Not a good news. But I found a road between mountains in a satellite map. So that was a hope to cross the mountain aera and made our way back to Beijing. 

The hotel was cosy and we all had a good sleep. 

### Back to Beijing

next day in the morning, we filled up the tank and carried on. The road conditions were not too bad to drive. I saw people's shocked faces who were looked at my car on the side of road. My car must look so bad. After 4 hours carfully driving, I passed the mountain aera. The highway was been opened again. We were so graceful and went to highway.

We arrived our home in Beijing at the night. The news showed there was snow still falling in that aera and lots of people were been stuck on thire ways. Also some car accidents happened during the time.

### Back to NZ

Next day, it was to time to go airport and catch the flight to Auckland. However, my wife stayed in Beijing, and My son and I went to Beijing. That was the moment when I felt so sad. I almost went to back and stay with my wife.

### Coronavirus

20 days later, when I arrived in NZ, the coronavirus broke out in Hebei in China. It was Chinese New Year holidays. People were on the way to visit their families. I missed and worried a lot about my wife. Especially, my wife is a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor. She has to go to work everyday. There is no way to protect her from the virus. I could not think more. Just pray for her! 

My son naturally misses his mother and keeps asking when his mom will come and join us.

On the valentine's Day, my wife, I hope you are well and We will be together soon!

Where is home? I think where family is in where is our home, where we could enjoy our life. I hope our resident visa will come to rescue us.
