I drove him to the school and attended the \"Preface\".</p>\n<p>In the Preface, we felt welcome and pleased to be here. After a presentation in Maori, a quote in English was been spoken. It gave me solemn feelings.</p>\n<p>All the kids sit down on the ground and listen patiently and properly. Later on, all children stood up and sang a maori song. Then we were lead to student hall and were been fed with delicious snacks.</p>\n<p>There were two girls from Terry's class there to cater us. They did really good job. Terry told me one of them is his friend.</p>\n<p>To Be Better Than Before! This is a motto from the Bledisloe School. I believe Terry will be better version in here!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/65a855438e0d67b072d13a9d2cf97fcc/971c4/preface_1.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Awesome image\"\n        title=\"Awesome image\"\n        src=\"/static/65a855438e0d67b072d13a9d2cf97fcc/c739e/preface_1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/65a855438e0d67b072d13a9d2cf97fcc/8ee9c/preface_1.jpg 148w,\n/static/65a855438e0d67b072d13a9d2cf97fcc/ebbe7/preface_1.jpg 295w,\n/static/65a855438e0d67b072d13a9d2cf97fcc/c739e/preface_1.jpg 590w,\n/static/65a855438e0d67b072d13a9d2cf97fcc/5413e/preface_1.jpg 885w,\n/static/65a855438e0d67b072d13a9d2cf97fcc/971c4/preface_1.jpg 1000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 10, 2020","path":"/preface-at-school","title":"Preface at School in New Zealand"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
