I dropped him and my mother into the school, Bledisloe. Before he took off the car, he took a few deep breathes. We met the principal and his teacher, Leigh Watts. Leigh looked very friendly and nice. She showed Terry's bag hook and greeted with Terry. Then I and my mother say goodbye with Terry. I also prepared some intrducing sentences for Terry to say when he need it. My mother decided to walk back to our house and I drove to my work.</p>\n<p>I hope Terry will have a great day today!</p>\n<p>Today's weather is very hot, 36 degree. But there will be a swiming class in the afternoon for Terry. I think he will love it!</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 03, 2020","path":"/first-day-at-school","title":"First Day For Terry at School in New Zealand"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
